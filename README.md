# Creating-a-PowerBI-report-to-track-partner-performance-for-Account-Managers

## Project Overview
This Partner Activity Tracking Project aims to leverage call and sales data to develop a set of metrics that characterize the behavior of business partners. These metrics provide account managers with the necessary insights to negotiate lead prices effectively, optimizing the return on investment for marketing campaigns.

## Repository Contents
Partner_Activity_Tracking_Data_Model.pbit: Power BI template file that outlines the data model used for the analysis.
Partner_Activity_Tracking_Report.pdf/jpg: Visual representations of the final report in Power BI, depicting various metrics and insights derived from partner activity.
Partner_Activity_SQL_Scripts.sql: SQL code that defines the data extraction and transformation logic for use in the report.

## Report Features
Hourly Performance Metrics: Tracks gross calls, billable calls, abandoned calls, sales, conversion rates, and more on an hourly basis.
Ancillary Sales Analysis: Highlights the number of ancillary products sold, assisting in the evaluation of cross-selling strategies.
Statewide Conversion Metrics: Breaks down call conversion percentages by state to identify geographic trends and variances.
Partner Performance KPIs: Includes key performance indicators for each partner, such as gross calls, billable calls, conversion rates, and cost metrics.

## Workflow Steps
Data Collection: Execute SQL scripts to gather relevant call and sales data from various partners.
Data Modeling: Use the Power BI template to create relationships and models that reflect the intricate connections between data points.
Report Creation: Develop a comprehensive Power BI report that visualizes partner performance across multiple dimensions.
Performance Monitoring: Set up the report to allow account managers to monitor partner activity and track lead performance over selected date ranges.
Negotiation Preparation: Equip account managers with detailed data so they can enter negotiations with partners backed by solid metrics.
Review and Adjustment: Continuously review the report outputs to refine strategies for lead pricing and partner engagement.

## Usage
